For my final project, I would like to create a security system that involves facial detection. I'd also like my project to allow for user input in order to grant access to a particular location or object. I currently own a microcontroller embedded with a camera. The product is known as OpenMV H7 has a variety of features such as frame differencing, color tracking, face detection, person detection and many more. This microcontroller also permits I2C communication which would allow for communication with my Arduino. 

At the moment I plan to use the following in some form: 
- ultrasonic sensor
- Gearmotor(s)
- Rubber Wheels
- Servo
- Character LCD
- Color Switches
- Potentiometer
- OpenMV H7
- Piezo Speaker

I have yet to decide how to use the aforementioned devices, but I'd like to create a system that is triggered as a response to sensor data which would in turn require the user's input for grant access.
