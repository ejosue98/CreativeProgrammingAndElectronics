For this implementation, I implemented a switch which functions as a reset button. When pressed, processing detects a change in value fed into Serial. Making different states for each portion of the game I first implemented signifactly reduced the amount of work needed for me to create this functionality. After the communication between Arduino and Processing was achieved, all I had to do was call the appropriate classes and methods to reset my game without the need to implement much more than what was already programmed.

The images above demonstrate the implementation of the electonic components in addition to their schematic. The Arduino and Processing files have also been updated and may be found within this folder.
